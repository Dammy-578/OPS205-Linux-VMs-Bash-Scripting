## 🧠 Overview
This project focused on creating and configuring two nested Linux virtual machines (Ubuntu and Fedora), performing common post-installation tasks, and building a Bash script to automate system queries. It highlights the fundamentals of Linux systems management and basic shell scripting.

## 🛠️ Key Tasks
- Installed Ubuntu 22.04.3 (Minimal Install) and Fedora as nested virtual machines
- Configured Cinnamon desktop environment and updated both systems
- Installed essential packages including Chromium and Vim
- Created two new user accounts on the Ubuntu VM
- Wrote a Bash script to:
  - Check user ID or system service status
  - Handle invalid inputs
  - Log output to `sysinfo-output.txt`
  - Display real-time results on screen
- All Bash script logic includes inline comments for clarity
