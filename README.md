## 🧠 Overview
This project involved creating two Linux virtual machines using Ubuntu and Fedora, performing essential post-installation tasks, and writing a BASH script to automate system queries. The goal was to gain hands-on experience working with Linux environments, system configuration, and basic scripting.

## 🛠️ Key Tasks
- Installed Ubuntu 22.04.3 (minimal install) and Fedora as nested VMs
- Configured Cinnamon desktop environment and updated both systems
- Installed key packages: Chromium and Vim
- Created two new users on Ubuntu
- Developed a fully commented Bash script that:
  - Accepts user input
  - Checks a user’s UID or service status
  - Handles errors and invalid inputs
  - Saves output to a file
